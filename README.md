The problem statement is to collect data closed price AAPL stock price data from the Quantrocket platform andapply algorithms to build  a simple model to make decision based 
on the stock prices.
The statistical model I used is a **MARKOV CHAIN MODEL** whose future state depends only on the current state and not the previous states. A state transition diagram was drawn, transition probability matrix was deduced and the portfolio value along with the buy indices based on the pre-specified logic was calculated. Apart from this, I also derived that these stock prices were in a stationary distribution both mathematically and visually. 
Further, time series forecasting was done using ARIMA model and the predicted results were plotted.


The detailed report and explanation of my approach is given in: https://github.com/krithikaa04/sw_hackathon/blob/main/sigmaWedge-report.pdf
